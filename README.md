# traditional-power-system-transient-simulation
Power system transient simulation considering synchronous machines(7-order differential equations and 2 stator equations).

The model is referenced in the book POWER SYSTEM DYNAMIC AND STABILITY, p. 135. It is a highly complex model that considers exciter and governer in synchronous machines.
